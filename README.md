# Whirligig

My approach for a react carousel.
At the moment it is built in NextJS but it will be packaged as a separate NPM package when it's good enough for real world usage.

## Features

- Smooth scrolling on both mobile and desktop by swiping
- Optional arrows
- Optionsl dots
- Automatically fit as many items as possible per page depending on the screen size
- Items can be anything, images, components, html.
- Typescript support.

## Not yet implemented

- Dynamic slide width
- Overwritable components, such as adding own arrows and dots
- Optional infinitie scroll
